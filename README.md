## **Introduction**
The client is a Real Estate company that invests in large cities by buying properties to later rent them out as vacation apartments.

The managers have decided to invest in Valencia and are interested in analyzing the data that the sector leader AirBnb makes public. The objective is to identify the types of properties with the greatest commercial potential for vacation rentals.

As a primary deliverable, the management expects to receive:
- Typologies of properties that the valuation team should prioritize.
- Main neighborhoods or geographic areas to focus on.

## **Objectives**
Analyze publicly available data to gain insights into the Valencia rental market and guide the valuation team‚Äôs research, especially in terms of:
- **Rental prices**
- **Occupancy levels**
- **Purchase prices**

## **Project Results**
1. **Identified 10 neighborhoods with high investment potential:**
   - **Low Investment**: CAMI REAL, MORVEDRE.
   - **Medium Investment**: FAITANAR, PENYA-ROJA.
   - **Medium-High Investment**: CIUTAT UNIVERSITARIA, BENIFERRI.
   - **High Investment**: MAHUELLA-TAULADELLA, LA ROQUETA.

2. **Focus on properties with the following characteristics:**
   - **Size**: 70 m¬≤, avoiding smaller properties of 50 m¬≤ or large ones of 150 m¬≤.
   - **Bedrooms**: Two bedrooms are preferred over three as they maintain the same occupancy rate but are more cost-effective.
   - **Guests**: Properties suitable for 4-5 guests with 3-4 beds have the highest occupancy rates.

3. **Avoid prioritizing proximity to points of interest:**
   - No significant impact on rental prices.
   - Properties further from points of interest often have a lower purchase price.

4. **Prioritize full apartment rentals:**
   - Full apartment rentals have better income potential compared to shared or private rooms.

5. **Opportunities for long-term rentals:**
   - **Medium Occupancy - High Rent**: EL PLA DEL REI.
   - **High Occupancy - High Rent**: CARPESA (limited data available; not considered optimal).

6. **Investment strategies based on size:**
   - **Medium Occupancy - Medium Investment**: Prioritize 70 m¬≤ properties over 90 m¬≤ ones as they offer similar occupancy rates but are more affordable.
   - **High Occupancy - High Investment**: Avoid 150 m¬≤ properties and focus on 120 m¬≤ ones, which are more economical (~‚Ç¨60,000 cheaper on average) and have the highest occupancy rates.
