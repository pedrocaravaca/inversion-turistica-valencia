## **Introduction**
The client is a Real Estate company that invests in large cities by buying properties to later rent them out as vacation apartments.

The managers have decided to invest in Valencia and are interested in analyzing the data that the sector leader AirBnb makes public. The objective is to identify the types of properties with the greatest commercial potential for vacation rentals.

As a primary deliverable, the management expects to receive:
- Typologies of properties that the valuation team should prioritize.
- Main neighborhoods or geographic areas to focus on.
